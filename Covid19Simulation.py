# I hereby certify that this program is solely the result of my own work and 
# is in compliance with the Academic Integrity policy of the course syllabus  
# and the academic integrity policy of the CS department.

# THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE RUN ON A MAC

# This program is a simulation of the spread of the Novel Coronavirus through 
# a population without any quarantine or social distance procedures. 
# It takes several conditions through user input and determines the spread of
# the infection based on these inputs, as well as a number of predermined 
# values based on real data on the coronavirus pandemic.

# Limitations on the accuracy of the simulation include, but are not limited to:
# 1. A cap on population size.
# 2. The population is completely isolated and has no influx of other, 
#    potentially infected, members.
# 3. The conditions which lead to a change in the status of an infected
#    member's infection are not completely accurate given the lack of 
#    research on Covid-19.
# 4. The simulation only considers possible spread when there is direct
#    physical contact between two members.
# 5. The size of the box in which the simulation takes place does not adjust
#    for larger populations. Thus, larger populations will spread Covid-19
#    more quickly.
